# StoreManagement

A store owner who primarily sells electronics items like mobile phones, laptops, digital watches etc. is 
looking for a store management system where he can manage his distributors, inventory, sales orders
and customers. Heâ€™s usually on the move so his expectation is that the developed system should also be 
functional on a mobile browser.
